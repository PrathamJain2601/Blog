Respected sir, 
This is my submission for the Blog Assignment.

Steps to set up->
1. Go to MongoDB Compass copy the connection link and pase it on 3rd line in app.js inside mongoose.connect() function.

2. Allot a free port of your system to the nodejs server on the 2nd line of app.js. Declare port variable with that port number.

3. Run the terminal in that specific directory make sure you are in same directory and it is working properly

In case of some issue in server running please try to switch off the proxy settings and then restarting the server.

After the setup now you can hit localhost://port-number on your chrome browser and view my blog submission.

Thank You Sir For reading
